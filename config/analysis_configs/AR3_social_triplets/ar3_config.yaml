# AR3 Base Configuration
# Shared settings for all AR-3 (Social Gaze Triplet) analysis variants.
# These settings centralize triplet detection methodology, statistics, and reporting defaults.

# Triplet Detection Settings
triplet_definition:
  # Valid triplet patterns: sequences of three consecutive gazes that count as social triplets.
  valid_patterns:
    - ["man_face", "toy_present", "woman_face"]
    - ["woman_face", "toy_present", "man_face"]

  # Gap tolerance: how many empty frames are allowed between consecutive gazes.
  # "gap_tolerant" mode with max_gap_frames: 2 means up to two frames can be skipped.
  require_consecutive: "gap_tolerant"
  max_gap_frames: 2

  # Age summary mode governs how age data is grouped in reports.
  # "child_vs_adult" collapses infant ages; "detailed" keeps each month separate.
  summary_age_mode: "child_vs_adult"

  # Toy absent mapping: during WITHOUT conditions, map substitute AOI to the canonical toy AOI.
