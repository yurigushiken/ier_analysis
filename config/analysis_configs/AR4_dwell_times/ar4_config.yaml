# AR4 Base Configuration
# Shared settings for all AR-4 (Dwell Time) analysis variants.
# These settings define the dwell time filtering, AOI analysis, and statistical methodology.

# Dwell Time Filtering Settings
dwell_time:
  # Minimum dwell time: fixations shorter than this (in ms) are excluded as likely noise.
  min_dwell_time_ms: 100

  # Maximum dwell time: fixations longer than this (in ms) are excluded (e.g., tracker loss).
  max_dwell_time_ms: 10000

  # Outlier removal: within each participant × condition, remove fixations beyond this SD threshold.
  outlier_threshold_sd: 3.0

# AOI Analysis Settings
aoi_analysis:
  # Focus categories included in dwell time summaries by default; variants can override if needed.
  focus_categories:
    - "toy_present"
    - "toy_location"
    - "man_face"
    - "woman_face"

  # Support categories retained for reference reporting (unused in calculations but documented here).
  support_categories:
    - "man_body"
    - "woman_body"
    - "man_hands"
    - "woman_hands"

  # Optional list of AOI categories flagged as primary interest (empty = include all).
  aoi_categories_of_interest: []

  # Minimum number of fixations required for an AOI to appear in summaries.
  min_gaze_fixations_per_aoi: 3

# Statistical Analysis Settings
statistics:
  # Minimum participants per condition required for valid statistical tests.
  min_participants_per_condition: 3

  # Linear Mixed Model formula (participant-level analysis).
  lmm_formula: "mean_dwell_time_ms ~ condition_name"

  # Optional extended model that tests AOI interactions; variants can override or disable.
  lmm_formula_by_aoi: "mean_dwell_time_ms ~ condition_name * aoi_category"

# Visualization Settings

  colors: {}  # Variants can supply condition-specific color palettes.
  show_secondary_plots: true
  violin_plot: false
  individual_alpha: 0.35
