# AR-4: Dwell Time Analysis Configuration
# Purpose: Analyze processing depth via mean dwell time per gaze event

analysis_name: "AR-4: Dwell Time Analysis"
description: "Analysis of mean dwell time (duration per gaze event) as indicator of processing depth"

# Dwell Time Calculation
dwell_time:
  # Unit for dwell time reporting
  time_unit: "milliseconds"  # or "seconds", "frames"

  # Outlier handling for extreme dwell times
  outlier_threshold_sd: 3  # Remove dwell times > 3 SD from mean
  handle_outliers: true

  # Minimum dwell time to include (filter very brief gazes)
  min_dwell_time_ms: 100  # 100ms minimum

  # Maximum reasonable dwell time (detect data errors)
  max_dwell_time_ms: 10000  # 10 seconds maximum

# Statistical Methods
statistics:
  # Primary test: Linear Mixed Model (accounts for multiple gaze events per participant)
  primary_test: "linear_mixed_model"

  # LMM formula specification
  lmm_formula: "dwell_time_ms ~ condition + (1 | participant)"

  # Random effects structure
  random_intercept: true  # Each participant has their own baseline dwell time

  # Analyze by AOI category
  analyze_by_aoi: true

  # LMM formula when analyzing by AOI
  lmm_formula_by_aoi: "dwell_time_ms ~ condition * aoi_category + (1 | participant)"

  # Multiple comparison correction when analyzing multiple AOIs
  multiple_comparison_correction: "bonferroni"

  # Effect size
  calculate_effect_size: true  # Cohen's d from fixed effects

  # Model diagnostics
  report_aic_bic: true
  check_residuals: true

# AOI-Specific Analysis
aoi_analysis:
  # Which AOI categories to analyze separately
  aoi_categories_of_interest:
    - "man_face"
    - "woman_face"
    - "toy_present"

  # Minimum gaze events per AOI to include in analysis
  min_gaze_events_per_aoi: 3

# Visualization Settings
visualization:
  # Primary plot type
  plot_type: "bar_with_error_bars"

  # Also generate violin plots to show distribution
  generate_violin_plot: true

  # Show individual participant means
  show_individual_points: true
  point_alpha: 0.4

  # Colors
  colors:
    - "#e67e22"  # Orange for GIVE
    - "#8e44ad"  # Purple for HUG

  # Figure dimensions
  figure_width: 10
  figure_height: 6

  # Axis labels
  xlabel: "Experimental Condition"
  ylabel: "Mean Dwell Time (ms)"

  # Separate subplot per AOI if analyzing by AOI
  subplot_by_aoi: true

# Output Settings
output:
  # Export gaze event-level dwell times
  export_event_level_data: true

  # Export participant-level means
  export_participant_means: true

  # Export AOI-specific summaries
  export_aoi_summaries: true

  # Generate diagnostic plots
  generate_diagnostic_plots: true

  # Include distribution plots in report
  include_distribution_plots: true
