# AR-4: Dwell Time Analysis Configuration
# Purpose: Analyze processing depth via mean dwell time per gaze fixation

analysis_name: "AR-4: Dwell Time Analysis"
description: "Analysis of mean dwell time (duration per gaze fixation) as indicator of processing depth"

recording:
  introduction: |
    Welcome to AR-4. In this walkthrough we focus on processing depth, quantified by the duration of each fixation.
    We compare how long infants dwell on the toy and social partners across GIVE and HUG events, highlighting the
    contrast between expected and incidental arguments.
  methodology: |
    We define dwell time as gaze duration in milliseconds and filter fixations that are shorter than the configured
    threshold. Participant-level means feed a linear mixed model with participant random intercepts while optional
    AOI analyses examine specific regions of interest.
  interpretation_guidance: |
    Pay close attention to whether GIVE conditions yield longer dwell times on the toy relative to HUG. Look for
    consistent differences in AOIs that align with argument structure predictions, and note any age-related patterns.
  outro: |
    This concludes AR-4. Review the statistical tables and figures for evidence of deeper processing when the toy is
    central to the event meaning. Use these insights to connect to the broader narrative established in AR-1 and AR-2.
