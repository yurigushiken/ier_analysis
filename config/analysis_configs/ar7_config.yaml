# AR-7: Event Dissociation Analysis Configuration
# Purpose: Demonstrate dissociation between visual attention and event understanding

analysis_name: "AR-7: Event Dissociation"
description: "Analysis comparing GIVE vs HUG vs SHOW to test whether seeing (SHOW) differs from giving/hugging"

# Condition Comparisons
comparisons:
  # Specific condition contrasts
  contrasts:
    - name: "GIVE vs HUG"
      conditions: ["GIVE", "HUG"]
      hypothesis: "Different gaze patterns for events with different argument structures (3-arg vs 2-arg)"

    - name: "GIVE vs SHOW"
      conditions: ["GIVE", "SHOW"]
      hypothesis: "Different social gaze patterns despite similar toy salience"

    - name: "HUG vs SHOW"
      conditions: ["HUG", "SHOW"]
      hypothesis: "Baseline comparison of 2-argument events"

  # Multiple comparison correction across contrasts
  correction_method: "bonferroni"

# Statistical Methods
statistics:
  # Primary test: Linear Mixed Model with multiple conditions
  primary_test: "linear_mixed_model"

  # LMM formula specification (condition as categorical predictor)
  lmm_formula: "gaze_metric ~ condition + (1 | participant)"

  # Random effects structure
  random_intercept: true  # Each participant has their own baseline

  # Pairwise comparisons with multiple comparison correction
  posthoc_comparisons: true
  posthoc_method: "bonferroni"  # or "holm", "fdr"

  # Effect size
  calculate_effect_size: true  # Cohen's d for pairwise comparisons

  # Planned contrasts (theory-driven comparisons)
  use_planned_contrasts: true
  contrasts:
    # Contrast 1: GIVE vs other conditions (3-arg vs 2-arg events)
    GIVE_vs_others:
      comparison: "GIVE vs (HUG + SHOW) / 2"
      hypothesis: "GIVE (3-argument event) differs from 2-argument events"

    # Contrast 2: HUG vs SHOW (both 2-arg, but different social structure)
    HUG_vs_SHOW:
      comparison: "HUG vs SHOW"
      hypothesis: "Social gaze differs between hugging and showing"

  # Model diagnostics
  report_aic_bic: true
  check_residuals: true

# Dissociation Criteria
dissociation:
  # Evidence for dissociation: significant difference in key metric
  key_metric: "social_gaze_pattern"

  # Minimum effect size to claim dissociation
  min_effect_size: 0.5  # Medium effect (Cohen's d)

  # Pattern prediction: SHOW should differ from GIVE in social gaze despite similar toy attention
  expected_pattern: "GIVE_social_gaze > SHOW_social_gaze AND GIVE_toy_attention ≈ SHOW_toy_attention"

    - "social_triplet_rate"
    - "gaze_to_recipient_face"
