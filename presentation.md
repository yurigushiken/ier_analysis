# Presentation: The Emergence of Event Structure in Pre-Linguistic Infants

## Slide 1: Definitions & Gaze Strategies

**Concept:** We moved beyond simple "looking time" to analyze the structure of the infant's gaze. We classified every transition between Areas of Interest (AOIs) into three distinct strategies.

*   **Strategy 1: Man Face ↔ Woman Face (Agent-Agent Attention)**
    *   **Definition:** Direct gaze shifts between the Giver and Receiver. Verifies shared intent and the social contract of the exchange.
*   **Strategy 2: Body ↔ Toy (Motion Tracking)**
    *   **Definition:** Gaze shifts between the hands/bodies and the moving object. Tracks the physical mechanics of the transfer without referencing the agents' minds.
*   **Strategy 3: Face ↔ Toy (Agent-Object Binding)**
    *   **Definition:** Shifts between an Agent's face and the Object. References the relationship between the person and the thing, but does not link the two people.

## Slide 2: The Rise of Agent-Agent Attention (Face ↔ Face)

**The Story:** Older infants increasingly verify the social connection between the actors.

**Key Finding:** There is a significant linear increase in this strategy from 7 to 11 months.

**Stats:**
*   Linear Trend (Infants 7–11mo): Significant (p = 0.025). Growth rate ≈ 4% per month.
*   Adults vs. 7-month-olds: Significantly higher (p = 0.006).

## Slide 3: The Decline of Motion Tracking (Body ↔ Toy)

**The Story:** As agent-agent attention rises, purely motion tracking falls. Younger infants are driven by the physics of the moving parts.

**Key Finding:** 7-month-olds devote over 50% of their transitions to motion tracking; this drops significantly with age.

**Stats:**
*   Linear Trend: Significant Negative Slope (p = 0.005).
*   7-Month-Old Baseline: Dominant strategy (>50%).

## Slide 4: Agent-Object Binding (Face ↔ Toy)

**The Story:** This strategy peaks at 9 months, serving as a "bridge" between motion tracking and full agent-agent attention.

**Observation:** 9-month-olds are obsessed with linking the Agent to the Object (~50% of transitions), but they have not yet graduated to linking the Agent to the Recipient.

## Slide 5: The Semantic Control (GW vs. UGW)

**The Question:** Are 10-month-olds looking at faces because they understand the meaning, or just because faces are attractive?

**Method:** We compared the standard "Give" (GW) to an Inverted "Give" (UGW).

**Key Finding:**
*   GW (Upright): High Agent-Agent Attention (17%).
*   UGW (Inverted): Agent-Agent Attention collapses to 0.8%.

**Conclusion:** The strategy is driven by semantic understanding. When the meaning breaks, the strategy disappears.

## Slide 6: The "Anticipation Gap" (Latency to Toy)

**The Concept:** Theory of Mind allows us to predict the transfer before it happens.

**The Finding:** Adults anticipate instantly. Infants—even the oldest ones—are significantly slower.

**Stats:**
*   Adults: 4.0 frames (Immediate/Predictive).
*   Infants (All Ages): 13–22 frames (Reactive).
*   Significance: Every infant cohort is significantly slower than adults (p < 0.01).

**Conclusion:** While 11-month-olds understand the structure (they look at faces), they have not mastered the efficiency (they are still processing, not predicting).

## Slide 7: The "Reaction Check" (Show Condition)

**The Concept:** In a "Show" event, the goal is the other person's reaction. Do infants check the Man's face?

**The Finding:** A massive deficit.

**Stats:**
*   Adults: Check the Man 52% of the time.
*   7-Month-Olds: Check 0% of the time.
*   11-Month-Olds: Check only 9% of the time.
*   All infant groups are significantly lower than adults (p < 0.001).

**Conclusion:** Pre-linguistic event representation is "Partial." They get the Agent (Woman) and the Object (Toy), but they miss the Social Goal (The Man's Reaction).

## Slide 8: Summary of "The Story"

*   **7-8 Months: Motion Trackers.** Driven by movement (Body ↔ Toy). Fast reaction times (reflexive).
*   **9 Months: Agent-Object Binders.** Obsessed with linking the Agent and the Object. Slower reaction times (processing).
*   **10-11 Months: Agent-Agent Monitors.** They have the "Trifecta" and check faces (Face ↔ Face), but they are still slow (processing) and miss the "Reaction" in showing.
*   **Adults: Experts.** Fast, predictive, and socially integrated.
