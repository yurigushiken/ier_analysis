  research_question: "Do participants fixate the giver, recipient, and toy location during GIVE-without-toy events?"
  hypothesis: "Infants younger than 10 months will fail to fixate all required arguments (including toy location) more often than older infants and adults."
  prediction: "10+ month infants and adults will show higher tri-argument fixation rates than 7–9 month infants, even when the toy is absent and only its location must be inferred."
