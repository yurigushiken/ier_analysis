  research_question: "Do participants fixate the show-er, observer, and toy location during SHOW-without-toy events?"
  hypothesis: "Infants younger than 10 months will fail to fixate all SHOW arguments (including toy location) more often than older infants and adults."
  prediction: "10+ month infants and adults will show higher SHOW tri-argument fixation rates than 7–9 month infants even when the toy is absent."
