ISSUE 1: UPSIDE_DOWN VARIANTS IN GIVE vs HUG COMPARISON
================================================================================

1. ALL CONDITIONS IN DATA:
   - FLOATING
   - GIVE_WITH
   - GIVE_WITHOUT
   - HUG_WITH
   - HUG_WITHOUT
   - SHOW_WITH
   - SHOW_WITHOUT
   - UPSIDE_DOWN_GIVE_WITH
   - UPSIDE_DOWN_GIVE_WITHOUT
   - UPSIDE_DOWN_HUG_WITH
   - UPSIDE_DOWN_HUG_WITHOUT

2. CURRENT AR1 LOGIC (Lines 116-124 in ar1_gaze_duration.py):

   give = participant_means[
       participant_means["condition_name"].str.upper().str.contains("GIVE") &
       participant_means["condition_name"].str.upper().str.contains("WITH")
   ]["toy_proportion"]

   hug = participant_means[
       participant_means["condition_name"].str.upper().str.contains("HUG") &
       participant_means["condition_name"].str.upper().str.contains("WITH")
   ]["toy_proportion"]


3. WHAT GETS SELECTED:

   GIVE conditions selected:
      - GIVE_WITH
      - GIVE_WITHOUT
      - UPSIDE_DOWN_GIVE_WITH
      - UPSIDE_DOWN_GIVE_WITHOUT

   HUG conditions selected:
      - HUG_WITH
      - HUG_WITHOUT
      - UPSIDE_DOWN_HUG_WITH
      - UPSIDE_DOWN_HUG_WITHOUT

4. SCIENTIFIC QUESTION:

   - UPSIDE_DOWN variants are BIOMECHANICAL CONTROLS
   - They test if the effect is about:")
     * Understanding event meaning (what we want to test)
     * vs. Visual motion patterns (control)"

   - Including them may:
     DILUTE the effect if upside-down reduces understanding
     STRENGTHEN if upside-down doesn't affect understanding
     CONFOUND if upside-down has different effect


5. POSSIBLE YAML CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:

Option A: Specify exact conditions to compare
---
comparisons:
  primary:
    group1: ["GIVE_WITH"]
    group2: ["HUG_WITH"]
  controls:
    group1: ["UPSIDE_DOWN_GIVE_WITH"]
    group2: ["UPSIDE_DOWN_HUG_WITH"]

Option B: Use pattern matching with exclusions
---
comparisons:
  primary:
    include_patterns: ["GIVE", "WITH"]
    exclude_patterns: ["UPSIDE_DOWN", "WITHOUT"]

Option C: Use condition tags/categories
---
condition_categories:
  upright_with: ["GIVE_WITH", "HUG_WITH", "SHOW_WITH"]
  upside_down_with: ["UPSIDE_DOWN_GIVE_WITH", "UPSIDE_DOWN_HUG_WITH"]

comparisons:
  primary:
    categories: ["upright_with"]
    contrast: ["GIVE_WITH", "HUG_WITH"]

ISSUE 2: TERMINOLOGY - 'GAZE EVENT' vs ALTERNATIVES
================================================================================

1. CURRENT TERMINOLOGY:

   Term: "gaze event"
   Definition: 3+ consecutive frames looking at same AOI
   Count in data: 26,560 (combined child + adult)


2. WHY IT'S CONFUSING:

   'Event' is OVERLOADED in this project:

   a) VIDEO EVENT (e.g., 'gw', 'hw', 'f')
      - The stimulus video showing an action
      - 11 types total
      - 150-185 frames long (~5 seconds)

   b) EVENT EXPOSURE / TRIAL
      - Each time participant sees a video event
      - Tracked by trial_number or trial_number_global
      - ~1,916 trials in child data

   c) GAZE EVENT (CURRENT USAGE)
      - 3+ consecutive frames on same AOI
      - ~26,560 in combined data
      - Detected by preprocessing pipeline


3. ALTERNATIVE TERMINOLOGY OPTIONS:

   Option 1: 'gaze_fixation'
      Pros:
         + Standard in eye-tracking literature
         + Clear meaning
         + Distinct from stimulus events
      Cons:
         - Technically 'fixation' has stricter definition (50-200ms)
         - May imply spatial stability

   Option 2: 'gaze_sequence'
      Pros:
         + Emphasizes consecutive frames
         + Avoids 'event' confusion
         + Accurate description
      Cons:
         - Less standard
         - Could imply longer duration

   Option 3: 'look'
      Pros:
         + Simple, intuitive
         + Natural language
         + Used in infant research
      Cons:
         - Too informal for scientific writing
         - Vague duration

   Option 4: 'gaze_bout'
      Pros:
         + Used in behavioral ecology
         + Implies sustained attention
         + Distinct from events
      Cons:
         - Unfamiliar to some readers
         - Could imply longer duration

   Option 5: 'gaze_episode'
      Pros:
         + Clear sustained attention
         + Distinct from stimulus events
         + Professional
      Cons:
         - 'Episode' has other meanings in development
         - Slightly verbose

   Option 6: 'fixation_event'
      Pros:
         + Combines standard term with current usage
         + Clear it's detected instance
      Cons:
         - Still uses 'event'
         - Fixation has technical definition

   Option 7: 'sustained_gaze'
      Pros:
         + Emphasizes 3+ frame requirement
         + Clear meaning
         + Natural
      Cons:
         - Longer phrase
         - Could be ambiguous about threshold

   Option 8: 'gaze_unit'
      Pros:
         + Neutral, technical
         + Clearly a unit of analysis
         + Avoids 'event'
      Cons:
         - Abstract
         - Less intuitive

4. FIELD-SPECIFIC CONVENTIONS:

   Eye-tracking research typically uses:
   - FIXATION: Gaze held on point for 50-200ms (spatial + temporal)
   - SACCADE: Rapid eye movement between fixations
   - DWELL TIME: Total time spent in AOI (sum of fixations)
   - VISIT: Entry into and exit from an AOI (may include multiple fixations)

   Infant research often uses:
   - LOOKING TIME: Total duration of gaze (our 'gaze_duration_ms')
   - LOOK: Instance of looking (informal)
   - GAZE: Visual attention (general term)

   Your definition (3+ frames on same AOI) is closest to:
   - 'Fixation' if requiring spatial stability
   - 'Visit' if allowing eye movements within AOI
   - 'Gaze bout' if emphasizing sustained attention
